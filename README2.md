Operations Dashboard Specification and Layout for RW Tool
Must-Have Functionalities for Operations Users

Comprehensive Report Monitoring & Status Tracking: Operations users need a consolidated view of all report generation activities. The dashboard should list each report (or job) and its current status (e.g. success, in-progress, failed) for the day or selected period. This allows quick identification of any issues in the reporting pipeline.

Automated File Syncing Monitoring: The tool should automatically ingest source files and move them to the designated locations, but ops users must see at a glance if those data syncs succeeded. For each source system feed, the dashboard can show a health indicator (green for success, red for failure) for the latest sync. For example, the RW Tool should accept incoming file notifications via API and transfer the file to the specified output folder automatically. Any failures in this file sync process should raise an alert (so ops can intervene).

Validation Results & Data Quality Checks: After files are ingested and reports generated, any validation rules (business logic or data quality checks) run on the data should be visible. The dashboard should highlight if a report failed validation or if there are warnings. An ops user should be able to click on a report and view detailed validation logs or error messages to understand issues.

Report Publishing Controls: Operations must ensure that validated reports are published to the end-user portal or shared drive. The dashboard should indicate which reports have been published and which are pending. Users should have the ability to manually trigger a publish or re-publish if needed, and confirm that published reports are accessible to the intended audience.

Date Filters & Range Selection: A date picker control is essential to filter the dashboard view for a specific date or range. Ops users should be able to select a From and To date to view historical report statuses or to retrieve past reports. For example, after selecting a date range, the list of reports for those dates is displayed (with pagination if needed). This helps in checking past days’ operations or re-running reports for specific periods.

Quick Report Search: A search bar allows operations to quickly locate a particular report or job by name or ID. As the user types, matching report names should auto-suggest (typeahead), so they can jump directly to that report’s status. This is critical when there are many reports – instead of scrolling, the ops team can instantly find the one they need.

Notifications for New or Delayed Reports: The dashboard should proactively notify ops when new reports become available or if expected reports are delayed. For instance, upon login the user might see a notification that “Latest reports for today are available” which they can click to view. Conversely, if a scheduled report hasn’t arrived by a certain time, an alert/notification could warn the ops user to investigate.

Sync Health Indicators: A visual indicator (icons or color codes) should reflect the health of various subsystems (e.g., data source connections or ETL jobs). For example, if the tool syncs files from 5 source systems each day, the dashboard might show a small summary (5/5 sources synced successfully, or highlight which source failed). This allows operations to ensure all data feeds are up-to-date.

Download and Export Controls: Ops users often need to extract report files for offline analysis or to send to stakeholders. The dashboard should provide download options for individual report files as well as bulk download. For example, after filtering a date range, the user can select multiple reports and click Download, and the system will package those files into a ZIP archive. This fulfills the requirement of downloading all reports between selected dates in one go. Individual download links (e.g. an icon in each row of the status table) should also be available for convenience.

UI Components for the Dashboard Page

Header Bar (Top Navigation): A persistent top bar providing global controls. It should include the application logo/title and context (e.g. “RW Tool Operations”). On the right side, it will display the logged-in user’s name and a logout button. This bar can also host a global date picker (for selecting the report date or range) and the search box for quick report lookup. A notifications bell icon may be present here as well, indicating new report alerts or system messages.

Sidebar Navigation: A vertical menu on the left side for navigation between sections of the tool. The sidebar items include: Monitoring (the main Operations Dashboard view), Sync (detailed sync status page), Validation (detailed validation results page), Published Reports (list of all final published reports accessible to users), Bookmarks (favorited reports or quick links), and Settings (configuration and admin settings). The Operations Dashboard page corresponds to the “Monitoring” section, which should be highlighted or selected in this menu. The sidebar provides quick access to related pages but remains collapsed or expanded as needed to maximize screen real estate.

Filters and Search Controls: At the top of the dashboard’s content area (just below the header), provide controls for filtering and searching within the dashboard. This includes a date range selector (From/To date picker) for filtering which report instances to display, a text search field for filtering the list by report name (this could be the same as or separate from the global search in the header), and possibly dropdowns to filter by status (e.g. show only failed jobs, only completed jobs). These controls allow the ops user to quickly narrow down the visible information to what's relevant.

Sync Summary Card(s): A set of small summary widgets highlighting the status of data synchronization processes. For example, a card could display “Data Sync Status: 5/5 sources updated” or “Last sync: 10 mins ago (All OK)”. If multiple source systems or feeds exist, there might be one card per source or one consolidated card that lists each feed with a green/red status. These cards are typically placed at the top of the dashboard content area as an at-a-glance overview. They help answer “Is all upstream data in place for today’s reports?” at a single glance.

Job Progress Tracker: A component (perhaps a panel or list) showing any active or recent report generation jobs. This could be a section of the dashboard where ongoing processes are listed with a progress bar or percentage (e.g., “Generating Report X... 45% complete”). If the system triggers report generation tasks or file transformations, the ops user can monitor their progress here in real-time. Once jobs complete, they might drop off this list (or show as 100% with status). This tracker ensures that the ops team can monitor long-running jobs without going to a separate page.

Report Status Table: The central component of the dashboard – a table listing reports or report batches and their statuses. Each row would typically represent a report (for a specific date or batch run) and show columns such as Report Name, Date/Period, Status (Completed, In Progress, Failed, etc.), Last Updated Time, and Actions (like view details or download report). For example, a row might show “Regulatory Report A – Oct 20, 2025 – Status: ✅ Published at 06:00 – [Download]”. This table should be sortable and paginated if there are many entries. It’s essentially the daily operations checklist where ops can verify each expected report for the day has arrived, passed validation, and been published.

Validation Logs/Details Viewer: When an ops user needs more information on a particular report’s status, they should be able to drill down. This could be implemented as an expandable row in the status table or a pop-up modal/panel that appears when a row is clicked. The validation logs viewer will display detailed messages, such as any errors or warnings encountered during data validation for that report. For example, if a report failed validation due to missing data, the logs viewer would show the specific validation rule that failed and which data points were problematic. This component helps ops quickly diagnose issues. It might also include links or buttons to view the raw data file or to re-run validation if applicable.

Alerts/Notifications Panel: A sidebar panel or a section in the dashboard that highlights important alerts. This can include system alerts (e.g. “Source system X failed to deliver today’s file” or “Report Y validation failed”) and notifications (e.g. “New reports for 20 Oct are now available”). This panel could be a collapsible region on the right side of the dashboard content. Critical alerts may be highlighted in red/orange with an icon (warning symbol), whereas informational notifications might be in blue or a neutral color. The alerts panel ensures that any exception or noteworthy event is prominently visible to the ops team, without the need to hunt through the table. (If screen space is a concern, the alerts could also be accessed via the bell icon in the header; however, having them visible on the dashboard page itself is useful for an at-a-glance view.)

File Activity Timeline: A chronological timeline (often shown at the bottom of the dashboard or as a separate tab) that logs key events in sequence. Each entry in the timeline would have a timestamp and a brief description of the event. For example: “05:30 – File received from Source System A”, “05:32 – File A loaded into staging database”, “05:35 – Validation completed for Report X (Passed)”, “05:40 – Report X published to portal”, “05:50 – File received from Source System B” and so on. This gives operations a historical view of the morning’s activities (or the selected date’s activities), which is extremely helpful for troubleshooting (“Where did the process stop or slow down?”). The timeline could be implemented as a scrollable list of events. It may also allow filtering by event type (sync, validation, publish) if needed. Essentially, it’s the audit trail of the reporting process for the day.

All these components should be organized in a clear layout so that the ops user’s workflow is intuitive. Common actions like searching for a report, checking if data has arrived, and viewing any errors should be immediately accessible from this dashboard page.

Diagram Key: The left Sidebar contains the navigation menu (the “Monitoring” item is selected, indicating the current page). The Top Bar contains the application title or logo on the left and user info & logout on the right, as well as possibly global controls like date and search. In the Main Content area, the top row provides filtering (date picker) and search, as well as a notifications icon. Below that, a row of Summary Cards gives high-level status info (e.g., sync status, validation summary, etc.). The middle of the content area is occupied by the Report Status Table, which lists each report and its status. To the right of the table, an Alerts Panel shows important alerts/notifications (e.g., failures or new report arrivals) for quick reference. Finally, at the bottom, a File Activity Timeline spans the width of the content area, listing events in chronological order. This layout ensures an operations user can filter the view by date, quickly gauge overall system health from summary cards, see the status of each report, notice any alerts, and review the sequence of operational events all in one page.

Backend Support Suggestions

To support the above dashboard features, several backend APIs and services are needed:

File Ingestion API (Source Trigger): An endpoint to receive notifications from source systems when a new report file is available. For example, the source system calls POST /api/reports/ingest with details like unique report ID, file name, file type, and target folder. This trigger allows the RW Tool to automatically fetch or receive the file and begin processing. It should respond back with success/failure, and errors should be logged for the ops dashboard to display if a file didn’t arrive as expected.

Report Listing & Status API: A backend service to retrieve the list of reports (and their statuses) for a given date or date range. For instance, GET /api/reports?from=2025-10-01&to=2025-10-20&page=1 would return a paginated list of report runs between those dates, including status info. This powers the Report Status Table and allows filtering by date. It should support pagination and perhaps filtering by status or report name.

Search API: To drive the typeahead search, an endpoint like GET /api/reports/search?q=<keyword> is needed. As the user types, the frontend calls this to get matching report names or IDs. It should return quick results (report names, maybe with recent dates) so that the UI can suggest completions. This could be optimized with an index for report titles. The same API might also be used for global search functionality.

Notifications/Alerts API: A service that the frontend can call to fetch recent notifications or alerts (or subscribe to them). For example, GET /api/alerts?since=<lastCheck> might return any new alerts (like “Report X failed validation at 06:00” or “Report Y available for download”). This could also be implemented with WebSockets or server-sent events for real-time push, so that the notification icon or alerts panel updates instantly when a new issue or report availability arises. On login, the system could call an API to get “latest available reports” which populates the notification that new reports are ready.

Real-Time Job Status API: For monitoring in-progress tasks, a backend mechanism is needed to provide real-time updates. This might be a WebSocket channel (e.g., /ws/jobs) that pushes events like “Job 12345 progress 50%” or a polling endpoint like GET /api/jobs/active that returns currently running jobs and their progress. This supports the Job Progress Tracker component so ops can see live status. The backend for this could tie into the job scheduler or processing engine (for example, if using a batch job system or message queue, it would expose the state).

Validation Logs API: When an ops user clicks to view validation details, the frontend should fetch the log or results via an endpoint such as GET /api/reports/{reportId}/validation-log. This returns detailed messages about the report’s validation (errors, warnings, pass/fail for each rule, etc.). These logs would be produced by the report generation process and stored (perhaps in a database or log store). Having an API allows on-demand retrieval to display in the UI.

Sync Status API: While some sync info is summarized in the report list, a dedicated API could provide detailed status of data sources. For instance, GET /api/sync/status might return each source system or feed, last sync time, and status (success/fail). This information populates the Sync Summary cards and allows a deeper Sync page to show history of file arrivals. It might overlap with the ingestion API’s data, but formatted for monitoring (e.g., list all expected files for the day and whether received).

Bulk Download/Export API: To support downloading multiple reports in one go (e.g., a date range of reports as a ZIP), the backend should provide an endpoint like POST /api/reports/export with parameters (report IDs or date range). The server would bundle the requested report files (which are likely stored in a repository or file system) into a ZIP archive and respond with a download link or stream. This fulfills the ops requirement to download reports for a specific period easily. Security and access control should be considered here to ensure only authorized users can fetch those files.

Authentication & Authorization Services: (Underlying support) The system should verify that the user has the ops role and appropriate permissions for these actions. While not a front-end feature, backend auth is crucial to ensure, for example, that only ops/admin users trigger re-publishes or see internal validation logs, whereas normal end users would have a different, restricted interface.

Each of these backend APIs should be designed for robustness and performance since the operations dashboard will be used to monitor real-time events. In summary, the backend needs to provide real-time data feeds (for job progress and alerts) and on-demand data retrieval (for listings, searches, and downloads) to support the rich functionality of the Operations Dashboard. All interactions (file ingest, status updates, validations) should be logged and exposed through these services so that the dashboard always reflects the ground truth of the financial reporting system’s operations.
